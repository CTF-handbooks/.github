## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

The CTF Handbooks organisation is home to the CTF Handbooks website - a collection of handbooks for the [Capture the Flag game by rubenwardy](https://github.com/MT-CTF) on [Luanti (formerly Minetest)](https://github.com/minetest/minetest). The handbooks are guidelines on a variety of tasks such as making maps and testing them, written primarily with the main Capture the Flag Luanti server in mind. The authors of this website and the community members gladly will welcome your efforts to bring the realm of CTF to new heights. When summed, even the smallest of steps can add up to great leaps!
